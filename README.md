# CookieRipper

Cookie Ripper is a browser extension based on the WebExtensions API. It makes it possible to specify cookie preferences on a global, per domain and even per cookie level. The extension features a nice user interface to see which cookies a website tried to set and selectively allow as well as modify them. The default behaviour is to convert permanent cookies to session cookies but it can be changed to allow all cookies or deny them. Your preferences can be checked and changed on several overview pages (cookies, site exceptions, whitelist entries). Both HTTP cookies and web storage are supported. This makes Cookie Ripper not only a powerful tool for privacy aware people but also for web developers and testers.
