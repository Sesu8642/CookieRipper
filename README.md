# CookieRipper

Cookie Ripper is a browser extension based on the WebExtensions API. It makes it possible to specify cookie preferences on a global, per domain and even per cookie level. The extension features a nice interface to see which cookies a website tried to set, a cookie editor and several overview pages (cookies, whitelist entries, site exceptions). Both http cookies and web storage are supported.
